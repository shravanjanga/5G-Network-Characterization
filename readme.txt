5G network offer great bandwidth and lower latencies. 
A key feature of 5G network is network splicing, with different sectors of applications such as industrial, automotive, mobile, etc.

Main objective: characterize a basic time synchronization protocol over different 5G network slices
This will be done by using the testbed from COSMOS labs
